# USP CICS Project
Wordpress stuff I made for the CICS project.

# Theme

Theme was made using bootstrap and some custom CSS / Plugins. All copyright images were removed from the source. The theme also depends on the following wordpress plugins to work:
- Advanced Custom Fields PRO;
- WEN Logo Slider;
- Contact Form 7;

# Plugins

The project is mostly based in custom post types.

The plugins `cics-equipe`, `cics-eventos` and `cics-pesquisas` are used to create the new post types and add some custom fields in the admin editor. They also include a widget to show a post list in the sidebar.

The plugin `cics-parcerias` creates a special slider (using the WEN Logo Slider plugin) that shows some logos on the index of the site.

The plugin `cics-manual` is a simple usage manual for the administrative staff that can be accessed directly from the wordpress admin.
